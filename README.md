#Project purpose
This project was built to gain knowledge and experience in using TypeScript with the React and Node.js libraries. Also I practiced to work with an external dashboard.

#Project description
This Project has been built as a fullstack application, using mongoose, express, react and node. For styling, I have used the styled-components library. I like to have documentation, by using individual tag names. The website was built without using external code. The only developer of this website is Roman Armin Rostock.

#General Informations
The website has two front-end interfaces and one back-end. One of the frontends is for clients who want to buy shoes. The other frontend called admin is for the admins to manage the website.
